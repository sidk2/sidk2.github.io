Hi, I'm Sid! I'm currently a third year at UC Santa Barbara, where I'm double majoring in Physics and Computing (at the College of Creative Studies). My current interests are in machine learning for scientific applications, and the physics and geometry of neural networks. I currently work with Jeong Lab at UCSB, researching the applications of ML in cosmology. In the recent past, I have worked for the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), on using GNNs for intefererometer simulation, and at OPUSLab, working on building hardware accelerators for combinatorial optimization. Prior to that, I worked at Astranis Space Technologies, and TenaFe Inc, among some other places.
